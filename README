  What is it?
  -----------

  Pmcma is a tool aimed at determining if a given software bug
  is an exploitable vulnerability by automatically writing an
  exploit for it.

  Like every powerful tool made by human beings, it is double
  edged : it can be used for good or evil.

  Is this tool for me ?
  ---------------------

  Pmcma has a wide range of applications, depending on your use
  of computer software.

  As an advanced user, you may experience software bugs in the form
  of crashes you are able to repeat and would like to report those
  bugs to software maintainers. Very often, sadly, they will not
  take your bug request very seriously until you prove them it may
  have serious security implications. In this case, attaching a
  pmcma output to your bug report may convince them to fix the bug
  (or not, if pmcma rules it out as non exploitable ;)

  As a system administrator, you may find Proof of Concepts or even
  proper exploits disclosed in public places such as security mailing
  lists or security websites and wonder if your own systems would be
  affected by simple modifications of those public codes (that usually
  never work "as is" anywhere but on the computer of their author ;)

  As a software developer or maintainer, you may experience or be
  reported segmentation faults in your software. Pmcma helps you
  determine what is happening at assembly level and determine which
  bugs are in fact vulnerabilities and should be fixed first.

  As a computer security enthusiast, you may want to learn more about
  software exploitation and experiment. Way to go !

  As a security expert or software hacker well versed in exploit writing,
  you may want to automate reverse engineering as much as possible to
  spend your time on what is specific to the particular exploit you are 
  writing.

  As a script kiddie, you may have found a piece of code you don't
  understand on the internet, but are nonetheless decided to go to jail.



  In all those cases, and surely many others, Pmcma was probably made
  for you.
